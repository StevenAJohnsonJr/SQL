# Book 4 - Handling the Growth of Carnival

With all the changes we've done, Carnival has really been automated.  Now we are using views and stored procedures to make getting and adding data so much easier.  The next thing we need to do is optimze the data structure.  To do this, we need to learn about Normalization and Transactions.
