# Database Backup and Restore

This chapter will introduce you to the concept of how to make a backup of your database so that you can restore it back to a certain point in time.

At this point Carnival's database has been built and data has been imported. Now we must consider, should we make a backup of the database in case something were to go wrong with the data. We first ask ourselves a question...Is our database in a good place to back it up. If we know that everything has been imported smoothly then we can export the database dump file.
