# Book 1 - Carnival Basics

Welcome to Carnival.  We are a fast moving company and that has just managed to get our database together.  Now we need you to get up-to-speed so you can update our documentation, build reports, automate common processes and optimze the design.  In this book, we'll help you get set-up and review some basic SQL.  Then we'll ask you to document our current database in the form of an ERD.
