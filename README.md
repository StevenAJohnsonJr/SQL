# Purpose of Course

This course is designed for people who have minimal to beginner knowledge of the SQL language. Perhaps you've dabbled with SQL in an online course, taken a bootcamp course in web development, or learned on the job by building some simple business reports.

In this course, you will learn the breadth of the core features on a relational database management system (RDBMS) with which you can unlock more powerful outcomes from your data, or if you are professional developer, learn to make your applications more efficient.

The depth of exploration is limited, as this course is more about exposure to the concepts so that you can go back to your job and apply the skills to begin your journey to mastery.
